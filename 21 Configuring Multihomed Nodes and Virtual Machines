### 21 Configuring Multihomed Nodes and Virtual Machines
The NMSTate Operator can help us to configure the nodes in order to be ready 
for the requirements imposed but the "NetworkAttachementDefinition"
The MachineConfigOperator could help us to configure the nodes, but it's very
intrusive, since when it applies the changes to the nodes, it needs to reboot them. 
It talks to the machine config deamon present on each node, applies the configurations
and then reboot them. 

The NMState operator does not need to restart nodes.
It collects the current network state of nodes creating some resources, and transforms
the changes that we want do make in network configurations policies. 

Install the NMState operator --> create an NMState instance to deploy the NMState controller
on all the nodes. 

You must create the NMState instance in the project openshift-nmstate.

It will create different resources: 

1 - NodeNetworkState (NNS): a readOnly resource that describe the network configurations. 
    There will be one NNS per node. In the status there will be the network
    interfaces and the configurations.

2 - NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy (NNCP): a resource that allows to change the node network
    configuration. It can manages different types of network interfaces like: Linux Bridge,
    bonding and Ethernet interfaces.
    NOTE: a Linux Bridge is a software feature integrated in the Linux Kernel. A Linux Bridge
          connects different physical or virtual interfaces forwarding the Ethernet frames 
	  based on MAC addresses. It's like a switch at data-link level. 
    NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy (NNCP) is applied to all the nodes in the cluster or just
    to a subset of nodes, for example to compute nodes. These resources are not namespaced,
    so you have to be a cluster-admin in order to see them. 
3 - When you apply the NNCP the operator will create a "NodeNetworkConfigurationEnactment (NNCE),
    that is a report about the changes on the node. If the node cannot be configurated to state
    expressed in the NNCE than it will rollback to the previous configuration giving us the data
    in order to troubleshoot.
