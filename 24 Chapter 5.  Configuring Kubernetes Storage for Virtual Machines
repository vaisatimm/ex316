### 24 Chapter 5.  Configuring Kubernetes Storage for Virtual Machines 

Backend storage can present storage to vm and pod like "block storage" and "FS storage".
The difference is that in the first case it gets presented a "raw" block device to pods and 
in the second case it gets presented a FS already prepared to pods and vms.

- "BLOCK DEVICE" case: you have to use the accessMode: RWO, unless there is some sort of mechanism that prevents
some sort of concurrent access to the block by two pods. VMIs use storage in Block mode and we will see how to 
enable the possibility to access in RWM. PVC with Block Device mode for a vm is difficult to configure.
- "FILE SYSTEM" case: if you have a NFS fs for example, you present al already formatted fs that can be share
and accessed by different pods at the same time. PVC with FS Device mode for a vm is not optimized for workload.

In the context of OCP Virtualization, if you specify a pvc in block mode, you usually specify a image disk source.
OCP V. would transfer the image onto the block device, this pvc can be attached to the virt-launcher pod as a block
dev and transfered to the pod as a disk block /dev/xvda. This is more performat because for each transfer there is a 
direct protocl attaching the block device.

OCP V. --> | Transfer the image OS onto the disk block | --> | The PVC gets the block | --> | PVC gets attached to pod | -->
--> | PVC gets transfered from the pod to the vm | --> | The VM sees the block |

If the pvc is in fs mode, the source image gets created on that FS as a disk image. It will be copied 
as cucow or raw image, disk.img. This pvc will be mounted in the pod and then it will be visible into the vm. 

Since these operations that involves the transfer of the image of the OS, are complicated then OCP V. introduces 
two new resources that helps to allocate the pvc and then the second to populate the pvc of the virtual machine. 

1 - StorageProfile: for each storageclass, there can be a storageprofile that will give you the default that are optimized
for virtualMachines disks. StorageProfiles are clusterwide resources. 

2 - DataVolume: describes how to initialize a disk. You can see what storageprofiles are available just taking a look at
the storage classes related. For example for the: 

   ocs-external-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization (STORAGECLASS) ---> there will be ---> ocs-external-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization (STORAGEPROFILE)

with the appropriate paramenters for the pvc: volumemode, accessmode, additional accessmode it will support. 

You can create a virtual machine disk by using a DataVolume, you can specify the size of the pvc and the location of the image in
qcaw or raw format.
