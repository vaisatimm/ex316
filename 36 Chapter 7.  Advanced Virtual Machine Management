$ virtctl vmexport create --vm=fedora-vmfedora-export

The vm-export has two formats: gzip and raw. 

To download a vm-export you need an export token, that is contained in a secret. 

-------------------------

$ virtctl vmexport download \
  fedora-export \ 
  --keep-me \ #to not delete the export after the download
  --manife \ #to include the manifest bundle (manifests of vm, disk, network config etc)
  --include-secret \ #to include the export token inside the manifests
  --output fedora-vm.yml

The manifests contains: 
- ca-certs;
- exports token for downloading the volumes;

If you want to migrate the vm from an existing ocp virtualization cluster to another ocp virt. cluster,
you just need to have the manifests, ocp will download the volumes.

The manifests contains: 
- configmap for the ca-cert;
- the secret for the export token;
- the virtualMachine definition (where there is the url to download the volume).

Before to export the virtual machine, you have to stop it. 

You can also create a vmexport from a snapshot. 

If you want to import the vm to another cluster than you have to apply the manifest into a project in 
the new cluster. 

The limit of virtctl is that you can import from kvm to kvm. 
If you want to import from another virtualizator you have to use the: Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV).

You can install the "Migration Toolkit for Virtualization Operator" from the Operator Hub. 
After the installation is complete you have to install a "VM migration controller" called "ForkliftController".

The forkliftController will create different CR in the openshift-mtv: 

- Provider;
- NetworkMap;
- StorageMap;
- Plan;
- Migration. 

The "Provider CR" stores attributes that enable MTV to connect to and interact with the source and target VM providers. 
The MTV can interact with the following hypervisors:

- VMware vSphere;
- Red Hat Virtualization (RHV);
- Openstack;
- Remote Openshift Virtualization Clusters;

Openshift virtualization can also import OVA, open virtual appliance.

In the migration toolkit you "validation services" that validate the suitability of each vm for migration.
It can generates a list of "concerns" for each vms to the migration of the virtualMachine. 
In the list of "concers" there are the features that the vm uses but OCP virt. does not support. 

In order to use the Migration Toolkit you need to create a NewtworkMap and a Storagemap CRs,
to map a source network and source storage to an Openshift network and to a storage class, respectively. 

You must create both network and storage mappings for a vm provider before starting a migration from that provider. 
Then you have to create a "MigrationPlan" that is a list of vm to migrate from the same provider, with the 
associated infrastructure mappings. 

When you have the "Plan" CR, then you can run the MigrationPlan, which executes that Plan. 

In the migration plan you can choose two types of migrations: 
- cold migration (default): shutdown the vm, transfer the data to the target cluster, then it power the vm on.
It is the safest migration, but it takes loger. 
- warm migration: uses 2 stages: create a snapshot, a pre-copy, while the vm is running. It transfers the snapshot
to the target cluster. Then you put the vm of the source environment in the cutover stage and the remaining data is 
copied to the Openshift cluster. Since the majority of data can be transfered, when the vm is running, of course 
the warm migration is much quicker. 

Depending on virtualization provider, the migration toolkit create importer pod or conversion pod.
The importer pod transfer the image of the virtualmachine in a dataVolume of the targeted OpenShift cluster. 
The conversion pod run the "virt-v2v" tool to install and configure the required device drivers on the vm root disk, 
for the vm to run on Openshift Virtualization, and then transfers the disk to a PVC. 

$ oc logs -n target_namespace -f importer-rhv

To cleanup all the resources that a vm migration involves, you must archive the migrationPlan. 
With that the migration logs are deleted. 

You have to remove temporary resources that might prevent some vm operations such as vm snapshots.

So it is recommended to archive migrationPlans as soon as you complete the migration.
