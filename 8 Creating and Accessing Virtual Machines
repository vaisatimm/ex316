### 8 Creating and Accessing Virtual Machines ###

Exposing vmi to ssh --> creation of NodePort. 

You can create only RH vms templates, but if you install the "Kubevirt common templates package", you can create templates for Ubuntu, Suse etc. 

Images in RAW or QCOW2 format --> ISO

You can use PVC as image, like clone of the PVC. 

You can use yaml to create vms or templates.

You can take snapshots of vms.

VNC allows you to access to graphical interface and command line interface.
Serial console only to text interface.

You can access to vms through virtctl:

$ virtctl console vm-name -n project-name (namespace)

or 

$ virctl vnc vm-name -n project-name (namespace) 

virtctl used with vnc subcommand calls the remote-viewer application, that needs to be installed in the vm.

You can make a port-forward to your local machine with the --proxy-only option that will open a port on your 
local machine and then you can access to the vm with the vnc client.

virtctl vnc --proxy-only -n test-vms centos-hello
{"port":34961}
go to another tab:

vncviewer localhost:34961

then it will open a window.
